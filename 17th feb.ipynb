    "MongoDB is a popular open-source document-oriented NoSQL database that uses a flexible schema to store and manage data. Unlike traditional SQL databases, MongoDB is a non-relational database, which means that it doesn't use a fixed table schema with pre-defined column types. Instead, MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, are databases that use non-tabular data models and do not rely on a fixed schema. They are designed to be more scalable, flexible, and faster than traditional SQL databases, making them ideal for storing large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media content, sensor data, and real-time data feeds.\n",

    "    High availability: MongoDB supports automatic failover and replica sets, which make it easier to ensure high availability and minimize downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Indexing: MongoDB supports indexing, which makes it faster to retrieve data by creating indexes on frequently used fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Aggregation: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows you to perform complex data analysis and transformation operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    MapReduce: MongoDB supports MapReduce, which is a powerful data processing framework that allows you to process large amounts of data in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In-memory processing: MongoDB provides in-memory processing capabilities, which can improve query performance by keeping frequently accessed data in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    JSON and BSON support: MongoDB supports both JSON and BSON (Binary JSON) formats, which allows for efficient data storage and retrieval.\n",
